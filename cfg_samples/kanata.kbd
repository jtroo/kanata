This is a sample configuration file that showcases every feature in kanata.
If anything is confusing or hard to discover, please file an issue or
contribute a pull request to help improve the document.

Since it may be important for you to know, pressing and holding all of the
three following keys together at the same time will cause kanata to exit:

  Left Control, Space, Escape

This is for the physical key input rather than after any remappings
that are done by kanata.

This mechanism works on the key input*before any remappings done by kanata.

;; Single-line comments are prefixed by double-semicolon. A single semicolon
;; is parsed as the keyboard key. Comments are ignored for the configuration
;; file.

#|
A multi-line comment block begin with an octothorphe followed by a pipe: `#|`.
To end the multi-line comment block, have a pipe followed by an octothorpe,
like the following sequence with the colon removed: `|:#`. The actual two
character sequence is not used because it would end this multi-line comment
block and cause a parsing error.

This configuration language is Lisp-like and uses S-Expression syntax.
If you're unfamiliar with Lisp, don't be alarmed. The maintainer jtroo is
also unfamiliar with Lisp. You don't need to know Lisp in-depth to
be able to configure kanata.

If you follow along with the examples, you should be fine. Kanata should
also hopefully have helpful error messages in case something goes wrong.
If you need help, please feel welcome to ask in the GitHub discussions.

;; One defcfg entry may be added if desired. This is used for configuration
;; key-value pairs that change kanata's behaviour at a global level.
;; All defcfg options are optional.
(defcfg
  ;; Your keyboard device will likely differ from this. I believe /dev/input/by-id/
  ;; is preferable; I recall reading that it's less likely to change names on you,
  ;; but I didn't find any keyboard device in there in my VM. If you are on Linux
  ;; and omit this entry, kanata will try to attach to every device found on your
  ;; system that seems like a keyboard.
  ;; linux-dev /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd

  ;; If you want to read from multiple devices, separate them by `:`.
  ;; linux-dev /dev/input/<dev1>:/dev/input/<dev2>
  ;;
  ;; If you have a colon in your device path, add a backslash before it so that
  ;; kanata does not parse it as multiple devices.
  ;; linux-dev /dev/input/path-to\:device

  ;; Alternatively, you can use list syntax, where both backslashes and colons
  ;; are parsed literally. List items are separated by spaces or newlines.
  ;; Using quotation marks for each item is optional, and only required if an
  ;; item contains spaces.
  ;; linux-dev (
  ;;   /dev/input/by-path/pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:1:1.0-event
  ;;   /dev/input/by-id/usb-Dell_Dell_USB_Keyboard-event-kbd
  ;; )

  ;; The linux-dev-names-include entry is parsed identically to linux-dev. It
  ;; defines a list of device names that should be included. This is only
  ;; used if linux-dev is omitted.
  ;; linux-dev-names-include device-1-name:device\:2\:name

  ;; The linux-dev-names-exclude entry is parsed identically to linux-dev. It
  ;; defines a list of device names that should be excluded. This is only
  ;; used if linux-dev is omitted. This and linux-dev-names-include are not
  ;; mutually exclusive but in practice it probably makes sense to only use
  ;; one of them.
  ;; linux-dev-names-exclude device-1-name:device\:2\:name

  ;; By default, kanata will crash if no input devices are found. You can change
  ;; this behaviour by setting `linux-continue-if-no-devs-found`.
  ;;
  ;; linux-continue-if-no-devs-found yes

  ;; On Linux, you can ask kanata to run `xset r rate <delay> <rate>` on startup
  ;; and on live reload via the config below. The first number is the delay in ms
  ;; and the second number is the repeat rate in repeats/second.
  ;;
  ;; linux-x11-repeat-delay-rate 400,50

  ;; Unicode on Linux works by pressing Ctrl+Shift+U, typing the unicode hex value,
  ;; then pressing Enter. However, if you do remapping in userspace, e.g. via
  ;; xmodmap/xkb, the keycode "U" that kanata outputs may not become a keysym "u"
  ;; after the userspace remapping. This will be likely if you use non-US,
  ;; non-European keyboards on top of kanata. For unicode to work, kanata needs to
  ;; use the keycode that outputs the keysym "u", which might not be the keycode
  ;; "U".
  ;;
  ;; You can use `evtest` or `kanata --debug`, set your userspace key remapping,
  ;; then press the key that outputs the keysym "u" to see which underlying keycode
  ;; is sent. Then you can use this configuration to change kanata's behaviour.
  ;;
  ;; Example:
  ;;
  ;;   linux-unicode-u-code v

  ;; Unicode on Linux terminates with the Enter key by default. This may not work in
  ;; some applications. The termination is configurable with the following options:
  ;;
  ;; - `enter`
  ;; - `space`
  ;; - `enter-space`
  ;; - `space-enter`
  ;;
  ;; Example:
  ;;
  ;;   linux-unicode-termination space

  ;; There is an optional configuration entry for Windows to help mitigate strange
  ;; behaviour of AltGr if your layout uses that. Uncomment one of the items below
  ;; to change what kanata does with the key.
  ;;
  ;; For more context, see: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/issues/55.
  ;;
  ;; windows-altgr cancel-lctl-press ;; remove the lctl press that comes as a combo with ralt
  ;; windows-altgr add-lctl-release  ;; add an lctl release when ralt is released
  ;;
  ;; NOTE: even with these workarounds, putting lctl+ralt in your defsrc may
  ;; not work too well with other applications that use WH_KEYBOARD_LL.
  ;; Known applications with issues: GWSL/VcXsrv

  ;; Enable kanata to execute commands.
  ;;
  ;; I consider this feature a hazard so it is conditionally compiled out of
  ;; the default binary.
  ;;
  ;; This is dangerous because it allows kanata to execute arbitrary commands.
  ;; Using a binary compiled with the cmd feature enabled, uncomment below to
  ;; enable command execution:
  ;;
  ;; danger-enable-cmd yes

  ;; Enable processing of keys that are not in defsrc.
  ;; This is useful if you are only mapping a few keys in defsrc instead of
  ;; most of the keys on your keyboard. Without this, the tap-hold-release and
  ;; tap-hold-press actions will not activate for keys that are not in defsrc.
  ;;
  ;; The reason this is not enabled by default is because some keys may not
  ;; work correctly if they are intercepted. E.g. rctl/altgr on Windows; see the
  ;; windows-altgr configuration item above for context.
  ;;
  ;; process-unmapped-keys yes

  ;; Intercept mouse buttons for a specific mouse device.
  ;; The intended use case for this is for laptops such as a Thinkpad, which have
  ;; mouse buttons that may be useful to activate kanata actions with. This only
  ;; works with the Interception driver.
  ;;
  ;; To know what numbers to put into the string, you can run the
  ;; kanata-wintercept variant with this defcfg item defined with random numbers.
  ;; Then when a button is first pressed on the mouse device, kanata will print
  ;; its hwid in the log; you can then copy-paste that into this configuration
  ;; entry. If this defcfg item is not defined, the log will not print.
  ;;
  ;; windows-interception-mouse-hwid "70, 0, 90, 0, 20"

  ;; Transparent keys on layers will delegate to the corresponding defsrc key
  ;; when found on a layer activated by `layer-switch`. This config entry
  ;; changes the behaviour to delegate to the action of the first layer,
  ;; which is the layer active upon startup, that is in the same position.
  ;;
  ;; delegate-to-first-layer yes

  ;; This config entry alters the behavior of movemouse-accel actions.
  ;; By default, this setting is disabled - vertical and horizontal
  ;; acceleration are independent. Enabling this setting will emulate QMK mouse
  ;; move acceleration behavior, i.e. the acceleration state of new mouse
  ;; movement actions are inherited if others are already being pressed.
  ;;
  ;; movemouse-inherit-accel-state yes

  ;; This config entry alters the behavior of movemouseaccel actions.
  ;; This makes diagonal movements simultaneous to mitigate choppiness in
  ;; drawing apps, if you're using kanata mouse movements to draw for
  ;; whatever reason.

  ;;
  ;; tap-hold parameter order:
  ;; 1. tap timeout
  ;; 2. hold timeout
  ;; 3. tap action
  ;; 4. hold action
  ;;
  ;; The hold timeout is the number of milliseconds after which the hold action
  ;; will activate.
  ;;
  ;; The tap timeout is best explained in a roundabout way. When you press and
  ;; hold a standard key on your keyboard (e.g. 'a'), your operating system will
  ;; read that and keep sending 'a' to the active application. To be able to
  ;; replicate this behaviour with a tap-hold key, you must press-release-press
  ;; the key within the tap timeout window (number is milliseconds). Simply
  ;; holding the key results in the hold action activating, which is why you
  ;; need to double-press for the tap action to stay pressed.
  ;;
  ;; There are two additional versions of tap-hold available:
  ;; 1. tap-hold-press: if there is a key press, the hold action is activated
  ;; 2. tap-hold-release: if there is a press and release of another key, the
  ;; hold action is activated
  ;;
  ;; These versions are useful if you don't want to wait for the whole hold
  ;; timeout to activate, but want to activate the hold action immediately
  ;; based on the next key press or press and release of another key. These
  ;; versions might be great to implement home row mods.
  ;;
  ;; If you come from kmonad, tap-hold-press and tap-hold-release are similar
  ;; to tap-hold-next and tap-hold-next-release, respectively. If you know
  ;; the underlying keyberon crate, tap-hold-press is the HoldOnOtherKeyPress
  ;; and tap-hold-release is the PermissiveHold configuration.

  ;; Alias for one-shot which will activate an action until either the timeout
  ;; expires or a different key is pressed. The timeout is the first parameter
  ;; and the action is the second parameter.
  ;;
  ;; The intended use cases are pressing a modifier for exactly one key or
  ;; switching to another layer for exactly one key.
  ;;
  ;; If a one-shot key is held then it will act as a regular key. E.g. for os1
  ;; below, holding an @os1 key will keep lsft held and holding an @os3 key
  ;; will keep the layer set to misc.

  ;; There are further variants of both of these:
  ;; - one-shot-press-pcancel

  ;; within the timeout will reset the timeout and advance the tap-dance to the

;;
;; Not to be confused with output chords (like C-S-a or the chords layer

;; input keys (a "chord") are pressed all at once (order does not matter).
;; Each combination/chord can perform a different action, allowing you to bind
;; up to `2^n - 1` different actions to just `n` keys.
;;
;; Each `defchords` defines a named group of such chord-action pairs.
;; The 500 is a timeout after which a chord triggers if it isn't triggered by a
;; key release or press of a non-chord key before the timeout expires.
;; If a chord is not defined, no action will occur when it is triggered but the
;; keys used to input it will be consumed regardless.
;;
;; Each pair consists of the keys that make up a given chord in the parenthesis
;; followed by the action that should be executed when the given chord is
;; pressed.
;; Note that these keys do not directly correspond to real keys and are merely
;; arbitrary labels that make sense within the context of the chord.
;; They are mapped to real keys in layers by configuring the key in the layer to
;; map to a `(chord name key)` action (like those in the `defalias` below) where
;; `name` is the name of the chords group (here `binary`) and `key` is one of the
;; arbitrary labels of the keys in a chord (here `1`, `2`, `4` and `8`).
;;
;; Note that it is perfectly valid to nest these `chord` actions that enter
;; "chording mode" within other actions like `tap-dance` and that will work as
;; one would expect.
;; However, this only applies to the first key used to enter "chording mode".
;; Once "chording mode" is active, all other keys will be directly handled by
;; "chording mode" with no regard for wrapper actions; e.g. if a key is pressed
;; and it maps to a tap-hold with a chord as the hold action within, that chord
;; key will immediately activate instead of the key needing to be held for the
;; timeout period.
;;
;; The action executed by a chord (the right side of the chord-action pairs) may
;; be any regular or advanced action, including aliases. They currently cannot
;; however contain a `chord` action.
