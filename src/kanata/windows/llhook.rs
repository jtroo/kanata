    ///
    /// ## Known issues
    ///
    /// - Ralt/lctl may have some issues with AltGr layouts
    /// - Some software may have a later-stage remapping that changes which VK is active for a
    ///   given VK that Kanata outputs. E.g. changing to roya/loya modifiers.
    ///
    /// # Description
    ///
    /// On Windows with LLHOOK/SendInput APIs,
    /// Kanata does not have as much control
    /// over the full system's keystates as one would want;
    /// unlike in Linux or with the Interception driver.
    /// Sometimes Kanata can miss events; e.g. a release is
    /// missed and a keystate remains pressed within Kanata (1),
    /// or a press is missed in Kanata but the release is caught,
    /// and thus the keystate remains pressed within the Windows system
    /// because Kanata consumed the release and didn't know what to do about it (2).
    ///
    /// For (1), `release_normalkey_states` theoretically fixes the issue
    /// after 60s of Kanata being idle,
    /// but that is a long time and doesn't seem to work consistently.
    /// Unfortunately this does not seem to be easily fixable in all cases.
    /// For example, a press consumed by Kanata could result in
    /// **only** a `(layer-while-held ...)` action as the output;
    /// if the corresponding release were missed,
    /// Kanata has no information available from the larger Windows system
    /// to confirm that the physical key is actually released
    /// but that the process didn't see the event.
    /// E.g. there is the `GetAsyncKeyState` API
    /// and this will be useful when the missed release has a key output,
    /// but not with the layer example.
    /// There does not appear to be any "raw input" mechanism
    /// to see the snapshot of the current state of physical keyboard keys.
    ///
    /// For (2), consider that this might be fixed purely within Kanata's
    /// event handling and processing, by checking Kanata's active action states,
    /// and if there are no active states corresponding to a released event,
    /// to send a release of the original input.
    /// This would result in extra release events though;
    /// for example if the `A` key action is `(macro a)`,
    /// the above logic will result in a second SendInput release event of `A`.
    /// Instead, this function checks against the outside Windows state.
    ///
    /// The solution makes use of the following states:
    /// - `MAPPED_KEYS` (MK)
    /// - `GetAsyncKeyState` WinAPI (GKS)
    /// - `PRESSED_KEYS` (PK)
    /// - `self.prev_keys` (SPV)
    ///
    /// If a discrepancy is detected,
    /// this procedure releases Windows keys via SendInput
    /// and/or clears internal Kanata states.
    ///
    /// The checks are:
    /// 1. For all of SPV, check that it is pressed in GKS.
    ///    If a key is not pressed, find the coordinate of this state.
    ///    Clear in PK and clear all states with the same coordinate as key output.
    /// 2. For all keys in MK and active in GKS, check it is in SPV.
    ///    If not in SPV, call SendInput to release in Windows.
