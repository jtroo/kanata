## Sample configuration file

The attached `kanata.kbd` file is tested to work with the current version. The one in the `main` branch of the repository may have extra features that are not supported in this release.

## Windows

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

Download `kanata.exe`. Optionally, download `kanata.kbd`. With the two files in the same directory, you can double-click the `exe` to start kanata. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup. See [this discussion](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193) for tips to run kanata in the background.

You need to run `kanata.exe` via `cmd` or `powershell` to use a different configuration file:

`kanata.exe --cfg <cfg_file>`

</details>

## Linux

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

Download `kanata`.

Run it in a terminal and point it to a valid configuration file. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup. See [this discussion](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130) for how to set up kanata with systemd.
```
chmod +x kanata   # may be downloaded without executable permissions
sudo ./kanata --cfg <cfg_file>`
```

To avoid requiring `sudo`, [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux).

## macOS

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

**WARNING**: feature support on macOS [is limited](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/platform-known-issues.adoc#macos).

First, install the [Karabiner VirtualHiDDevice Driver](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/blob/main/dist/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice-3.1.0.pkg).

To activate it:

```
/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate
```

Download `kanata_macos`.

Run it in a terminal and point it to a valid configuration file. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup.

```
chmod +x kanata_macos   # may be downloaded without executable permissions
sudo ./kanata_macos --cfg <cfg_file>`
```

## cmd_allowed variants

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

The binaries with the name `cmd_allowed` are conditionally compiled with the `cmd` action enabled.

Using the regular binaries, there is no way to get the `cmd` action to work. This action is restricted behind conditional compilation because I consider the action to be a security risk that should be explicitly opted into and completely forbidden by default.

## wintercept variants

<details>
<summary>Explanation and instructions</summary>

### Warning: known issue

This issue in the Interception driver exists: https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/issues/25. This will affect you if you put your PC to sleep instead of shutting it down, or if you frequently plug/unplug USB devices.

### Description

These variants use the [Interception driver](http://www.oblita.com/interception) instead of Windows hooks. You will need to install the driver using the assets from the linked website or from the [copy in this repo](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/tree/main/assets). The benefit of using this driver is that it is a lower-level mechanism than Windows hooks. This means `kanata` will work in more applications, including administrator-privileged apps.

### Steps to install the driver

- extract the `.zip`
- run a shell with administrator privilege
- run the script `"command line installer/install-interception.exe"`
- reboot

### Additional installation steps

The above steps are those recommended by the interception driver author. However, I have found that those steps work inconsistently and sometimes the dll stops being able to be loaded. I think it has something to do with being installed in the privileged location of `system32\drivers`.

To help with the dll issue, you can copy the following file in the zip archive to the directory that kanata starts from: `Interception\library\x64\interception.dll`.

E.g. if you start kanata from your `Documents` folder, put the file there:

```
C:\Users\my_user\Documents\
    kanata_wintercept.exe
    kanata.kbd
    interception.dll
```

## kanata_passthru.dll

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

The Windows `kanata_passthru.dll` file allows using Kanata as a library within AutoHotkey to avoid
conflicts between keyboard hooks installed by both. You can channel keyboard input events received
by AutoHotkey into Kanata's keyboard engine and get the transformed keyboard output events (per your 
Kanata config) that AutoHotkey can then send to the OS.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

Download `kanata_passthru.dll`, then the [simulated_passthru_ahk](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/simulated_passthru_ahk) folder with a brief
example, place the dll there, open `kanata_passthru.ahk` to read what the example does and
then double-click to launch it.
