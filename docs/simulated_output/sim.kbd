(defcfg
  process-unmapped-keys	yes	;;|no| enable processing of keys that are not in defsrc, useful if mapping a few keys in defsrc instead of most of the keys on your keyboard. Without this, the tap-hold-release and tap-hold-press actions will not activate for keys that are not in defsrc. Disabled because some keys may not work correctly if they are intercepted. E.g. rctl/altgr on Windows; see the windows-altgr configuration item above for context.
