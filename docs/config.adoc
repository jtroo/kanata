This document describes how to create a kanata configuration file. The kanata
configuration file will determine your keyboard behaviour upon running kanata.

The configuration file uses S-expression syntax from Lisps. If you are not
familiar with any Lisp-like programming language, do not be too worried. This
document will hopefully be a sufficient guide to help you customize your
keyboard behaviour to your exact liking.

If you have any questions or confusions, feel free to file an issue or start a
discussion. If you have ideas for how to improve this document or any other
part of the project, please be welcome to make a pull request or file an issue.

'''

[[table-of-contents]]
== Table of contents
toc::[]

== Comments
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You can add comments to your configuration file. Comments are prefixed with two
semicolons. E.g:

----
;; This is a comment in a kanata configuration file.
;; There is no special syntax for multi-line comments at this time.
;; Comments will be ignored and are intended for you to help understand your
;; own configuration when reading it later.
----

== Required configuration entries

=== defcfg
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

Your configuration file must have a `defcfg` entry.

It can be empty but there are options that can change kanata's behaviour that
will be described later.

Example:

----
(defcfg)
----

=== defsrc
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

Your configuration file must have exactly one `defsrc` entry. This defines the
order of keys that the `+deflayer+` entries will operate on.

A `defsrc` entry is composed of `defsrc` followed by key names that are
separated by whitespace.

It should be noted that the `defsrc` entry is treated as a long sequence; the
amount of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) are not relevant. You may use
spaces, tabs, or newlines however you like to visually format `defsrc` to your
liking.

An example `defsrc` containing the standard QWERTY keyboard keys as an
approximately 60% keyboard layout:

----
(defsrc
  grv  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0    -    =    bspc
  tab  q    w    e    r    t    y    u    i    o    p    [    ]    \
  caps a    s    d    f    g    h    j    k    l    ;    '    ret
  lsft z    x    c    v    b    n    m    ,    .    /    rsft
  lctl lmet lalt           spc            ralt rmet rctl
)
----

=== deflayer
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

Your configuration file must have at least one `+deflayer+` entry. This defines
how each physical key mapped in `+defsrc+` behaves when kanata runs.

A `+deflayer+` configuration entry is followed by the layer name then a list of
keys or actions. The usable key names are the same as in defsrc. Actions are
explained further on in this document. The whitespace story is the same as with
`+defsrc+`. The order of keys/actions in `+deflayer+` corresponds to the
physical key in the same sequence position defined in `+defsrc+`.

The first layer defined in your configuration file will be the starting layer
when kanata runs. Other layers can be temporarily activated or switched to
using actions. There is currently a maximum of 25 layers allowed.

An example `defsrc` and `deflayer` that remaps QWERTY to the Dvorak layout
would be:

----
(defsrc
  grv  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0    -    =    bspc
  tab  q    w    e    r    t    y    u    i    o    p    [    ]    \
  caps a    s    d    f    g    h    j    k    l    ;    '    ret
  lsft z    x    c    v    b    n    m    ,    .    /    rsft
  lctl lmet lalt           spc            ralt rmet rctl
)

(deflayer dvorak
  grv  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0    [    ]    bspc
  tab  '    ,    .    p    y    f    g    c    r    l    /    =    \
  caps a    o    e    u    i    d    h    t    n    s    -    ret
  lsft ;    q    j    k    x    b    m    w    v    z    rsft
  lctl lmet lalt           spc            ralt rmet rctl
)
----

=== Review of required configuration entries
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

If you're reading in order, you have now seen all of the required entries:

* `+defcfg+`
* `+defsrc+`
* `+deflayer+`

An example minimal configuration is:

----
(defcfg)

(defsrc a b c)

(deflayer start 1 2 3)
----

This will make kanata remap your `a b c` keys to `1 2 3`. This is almost
certainly undesirable but is a valid configuration.

== Optional defcfg entries

There are a few `defcfg` entries that are used to customize various kanata
behaviours.

=== process-unmapped-keys
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

Enabling this configuration makes kanata process keys that are not in defsrc.
This is useful if you are only mapping a few keys in defsrc instead of most of
the keys on your keyboard.

Without this, the `+rpt+`, `+tap-hold-release+`, `+tap-hold-press+`, and
`+defseq+` actions will not activate for keys that are not in defsrc.

This is disabled by default. The reason this is not enabled by default is
because some keys may not work correctly if they are intercepted. For example,
see the <<windows-only-windows-altgr>> option below.

Example:

----
(defcfg
  process-unmapped-keys yes
)
----

=== danger-enable-cmd
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

This option can be used to enable the `cmd` action in your configuration. The
`+cmd+` action allows kanata to execute programs with arguments passed to them.

This requires using a kanata program that is compiled with the `cmd` action
enabled. The reason for this is so that if you choose to, there is no way for
kanata to execute arbitrary programs even if you download some random
configuration from the internet.

This configuration is disabled by default and can be enabled by giving it the
value `yes`.

Example:

----
(defcfg
  danger-enable-cmd yes
)
----

=== sequence-timeout
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

This option customizes the key sequence timeout (unit: ms). Its default value
is 1000. The purpose of this item is explained in <<sequences>>.

Example:

----
(defcfg
  sequence-timeout 2000
)
----

=== Linux only: linux-dev
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

By default, kanata will try to detect which input devices are keyboards and try
to intercept them all. However, you may specify exact keyboard devices from the
`/dev/input` directories using the `linux-dev` configuration.

Example:

----
(defcfg
  linux-dev /dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd
)
----

If you want to specify multiple keyboards, you can separate the paths with a
colon `+:+`. Example:

----
(defcfg
  linux-dev /dev/input/dev1:/dev/input/dev2
)
----

Due to using the colon to separate devices, if you have a device with colons in
its file name, you must escape those colons with backslashes:

----
(defcfg
  linux-dev /dev/input/path-to\:device
)
----

=== Windows only: windows-altgr
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

There is an option for Windows to help mitigate the strange behaviour of AltGr
(ralt) if you're using that key in your defsrc. This is applicable for many
non-US layouts. You can use one of the listed values to change what kanata does
with the key:

* `cancel-lctl-release`
** This will remove the `lctl` press that is generated alonside `ralt`
* `add-lctl-release`
** This adds an `lctl` release when `ralt` is released

Example:

----
(defcfg
  windows-altgr add-lctl-release
)
----

For more context, see: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/issues/55.

NOTE: Even with these workarounds, putting `+lctl+`+`+ralt+` in your defsrc may not
work properly with other applications that also use keyboard interception.
Known applications with issues:

* GWSL/VcXsrv

=== Using multiple defcfg entries
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `defcfg` entry is treated as a list with pairs of strings. For example:

----
(defcfg a 1 b 2)
----

This will be treated as configuration `a` having value `1` and configuration
`b` having value `2`.

An example defcfg containing all of the options is shown below. It should be
noted options that are Linux-only or Windows-only will be ignored when used on
a non-applicable operating system.

----
(defcfg
  process-unmapped-keys yes
  danger-enable-cmd yes
  sequence-timeout 2000
  linux-dev /dev/input/dev1:/dev/input/dev2
  windows-altgr add-lctl-release
)
----

== Aliases
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

Before learning about actions, it will be useful to first learn about aliases.
Using the `defalias` configuration entry, you can introduce a shortcut label
for an action.

Similar to how `defcfg` works, `defalias` reads pairs of items in a sequence
where the first item in the pair is the alias name and the second item is the
action it can be substituted for. However, unlike `+defcfg+`, the second item
in `defalias` may be a "list" as opposed to a single string like it was in
`defcfg`.

A list is a sequence of strings separated by whitespace, surrounded by
parentheses. All of the configuration entries we've looked at so far are lists;
`defalias` is where we'll first see nested lists in this guide.

Example:

----
(defalias
  ;; tap for caps lock, hold for left control
  cap (tap-hold 200 200 caps lctl)
)
----

This alias can be used in `deflayer` as a substitute for the long action. The
alias name is prefixed with `@` to signify that it's an alias as opposed to a
normal key.

----
(deflayer example
  @cap a s d f
)
----

You may have multiple `defalias` entries and multiple aliases within a single
`defalias`. Aliases may also refer to other aliases that were defined earlier
in the configuration file.

Example:

----
(defalias one (tap-hold 200 200 caps lctl))
(defalias two (tap-hold 200 200 esc lctl))
(defalias
  three C-A-del ;; Ctrl+Alt+Del
  four (tap-hold 200 200 @three ralt)
)
----

You can choose to put actions without aliasing them right into `deflayer`.
However, for long actions it is recommended not to do so to keep a nice visual
alignment. Visually aligning your `deflayer` entries will hopefully make your
configuration file easier to read.

Example:

----
(deflayer example
  ;; this is equivalent to the previous deflayer example
  (tap-hold 200 200 caps lctl) a s d f
)
----

== Actions

The actions kanata provides are what make it truly customizable. This section
explains the available actions.

=== Live reload
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You can put the `+lrld+` action onto a key to live-reload your configuration
file. If kanata can't parse the file, it will continue using the previous
configuration.

It should be noted that the live reload action currently leaks memory. In
practice this should not matter. Some measurements on Windows for version
1.0.0:

* 20 reloads: 15.4 MB memory consumed
* 50 reloads: 20.4 MB memory consumed

This is about 170 KB used per live reload. In more recent versions the memory
usage per reload has likely more than doubled, but even still, in practice this
is negligible memory usage compared to other applications like a browser.

Example:

----
(deflayer has-live-reload
  lrld a s d f
)
----

=== Repeat key
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The action `+rpt+` repeats the most recently typed key. Holding down this key
will not repeatedly send the key. The intended use case is to be able to use a
different finger or even thumb key to repeat a double layer, as opposed to
double-tapping a key.

Example:

----
(deflayer has-repeat
  rpt a s d f
)
----

=== layer-switch
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

This action allows you to switch to another "base" layer. This is permanent
until a `layer-switch` to another layer is activated. The concept of a base
layer makes more sense when looking at the next action: `layer-while-held`.

This action accepts a single subsequent string which must be a layer name
defined in a `deflayer` entry.

Example:

----
(defalias dvk (layer-switch dvorak))
----

=== layer-while-held
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

This action allows you to temporarily change to another layer while the key
remains held. When the key is released, you go back to the currently active
"base" layer.

This action accepts a single subsequent string which must be a layer name
defined in a `deflayer` entry.

Example:

----
(defalias nav (layer-while-held navigation))
----

You may also use `layer-toggle` in place of `layer-while-held`; they behave
exactly the same. The `layer-toggle` name is slightly shorter but is a bit
inaccurate with regards to its meaning.

=== Transparent key
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

If you use a single underscore for a key `+_+` then it acts as a "transparent"
key in a `+deflayer+`. The behaviour depends if `+_+` is on a base layer or a
while-held layer. When `+_+` is pressed on the active base layer, the key will
default to the corresponding `defsrc` key. If `+_+` is pressed on the active
while-held layer, the base layer's behaviour will activate.

Example:

----
(defsrc
  a b c
)

(deflayer remap-only-c-to-d
  _ _ d
)
----

=== No-op
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You may use the action `+XX+` as a "no operation" key, meaning pressing the key
will do nothing. This might be desirable in place of a transparent key on an
layer that is not fully mapped so that a key that is intentionally not mapped
will do nothing as opposed to typing a letter.

Example:

----
(deflayer contains-no-op
  XX a s d f
)
----

=== Unicode
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+unicode+` action accepts a single unicode character. The character will
not be repeatedly typed if you hold the key down.

You may use a unicode character as an alias if desired.

NOTE: The unicode action may not be correctly accepted by the active
application.

----
(defalias
  sml (unicode 😀)
  🙁 (unicode 🙁)
)
(deflayer has-happy-sad
  @sml @🙁 a s d f
)
----

=== Chords
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You may want to remap a key to automatically be pressed in combination with
modifiers such as Control or Shift. There is a shortcut for this: prefix the
normal key name with one or more of:

* `+C-+`: Left Control
* `+A-+`: Left Alt
* `+S-+`: Left Shift
* `+M-+`: Left Meta, a.k.a. Windows, GUI, Command, Super
* `+RA-+` or `+AG+`: Right Alt, a.k.a. AltGr

These modifiers may be combined together if desired.

Example:

----
(defalias
  ;; Ctrl+C: send SIGINT to a Linux terminal program
  int C-c
  ;; Win+Tab: open Windows' Task View
  tsk M-tab
  ;; Ctrl+Shift+(C|V): copy or paste from certain terminal programs
  cpy C-S-c
  pst C-S-v
)
----

This is stated to be a shortcut because the behaviour can be replicated with
the `+multi+` action which is showcased later in this document.

=== Release a key or layer
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You can release a held key or layer via these actions:

* `release-key`: release a key, accepts `defsrc` compatible names
* `release-layer`: release a while-held layer

An example practical use case for `release-key` is seen in the `multi` section
directly below.

There is currently no known practical use case for
`release-layer`, but it exists nonetheless.

=== multi
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+multi+` action executes multiple keys or actions in order but also
simultaneously. It accepts one or more actions.

This action may result in unexpected or incorrect behaviour if combining
complicated actions. If you find incorrect behaviour, please feel free to file
an issue.

An example use case is to press the "Alt" key while also activating another
layer.

In the example below, holding the physical "Alt" key will result in a held
layer being activated while also holding "Alt" itself. The held layer operates
nearly the same as the standard keyboard, so for example the sequence (hold
Alt)+(Tab+Tab+Tab) will work as expected. This is in contrast to having a layer
where `tab` is mapped to `A-tab`, which results in repeated press+release of
the two keys and has different behaviour than expected. Some special keys will
release the "Alt" key and do some other action that requires "Alt" to be
released. In other words, the "Alt" key serves a dual purpose of still
fulfilling the "Alt" key role for some button presses (e.g. Tab), but also as a
new layer for keys that aren't typically used with "Alt" to have added useful
functionality.

----
(defalias
  atl (multi alt (layer-while-held alted-with-exceptions))
  lft (multi (release-key alt) left) ;; release alt if held and also press left
  rgt (multi (release-key alt) rght) ;; release alt if held and also press rght
)

(defsrc
  alt  a    s    d    f
)

(deflayer base
  @atl _    _    _    _
)

(deflayer alted-with-exceptions
  _    _    _    @lft @rgt
)
----

=== Mouse actions
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You can click the left, middle, and right buttons using kanata actions as well as
do vertical and horizontal scrolling.

The mouse button actions are:

* `mlft`: left mouse button
* `mmid`: middle mouse button
* `mrgt`: right mouse button

The mouse button will be held while the key mapped to it is held.

If there are multiple mouse click actions within a single multi action, e.g.

`+(multi mrgt mlft)+`

then all the buttons except the last will be clicked then unclicked. The last
button will remain held until key release. In the example above, pressing then
releasing the key mapped to this action will result in the following event
sequence:

. press key mapped to `+multi+`
. click right mouse button
. unclick right mouse button
. click left mouse button
. release key mapped to `+multi+`
. release left mouse button

There are variants of the standard mouse buttons which "tap" the button. Rather
than holding the button while the key is held, a mouse click will be
immediately followed by the release. Nothing happens when the key is released.
The actions are as follows:

* `mltp`: tap left mouse button
* `mmtp`: tap middle mouse button
* `mrtp`: tap right mouse button

The mouse wheel actions are:

* `mwheel-up`: vertical scroll up
* `mwheel-down`: vertical scroll down
* `mwheel-left`: horizontal scroll left
* `mwheel-right`: horizontal scroll right

All of these actions accept two number strings. The first is the interval
(unit: milliseconds) between scroll actions. The second number is the distance
(unit: arbitrary). In both Windows and Linux, 120 distance units is equivalent
to a notch movement on a physical wheel. You can play with the parameters to
see what feels correct to you. Both numbers must be in the range [1,65535].

NOTE: Notch movement on a physical wheel. In Linux, not all desktop
environments support the `REL_WHEEL_HI_RES` event so kanata just doesn't use
it. Instead, a scroll happens when 120 or more distance units are accumulated.
This may result in poor scrolling experience so in Linux it is recommended to
use a distance value that is a multiple of 120.

Example:

----
(defalias
  mwu (mwheel-up 50 120)
  mwd (mwheel-down 50 120)
  mwl (mwheel-left 50 120)
  mwr (mwheel-right 50 120)
)

(deflayer mouse
  _    @mwu @mwd @mwl @mwr _    _    _    _    _    _    _    _    _
  _    _    bck  _    fwd  _    _    _    _    _    _    _    _    _
  _    _    mlft _    mrgt mmid _    _    _    _    _    _    _
  _    _    mltp _    mrtp mmtp _    _    _    _    _    _
  _    _    _              _              _    _    _
)
----

=== tap-dance
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+tap-dance+` action allows repeated tapping of a key to result in
different actions. It is followed by a timeout (unit: ms) and a list
of keys or actions. Each time the key is pressed, its timeout will reset. The
action will be chosen if one of the following events occur:

* the timeout expires
* a different key is pressed
* the key is repeated up to the final action

You may put normal keys or other actions in `+tap-dance+`.

Example:

----
(defalias
  ;; 1 tap : "A" key
  ;; 2 taps: Control+C
  ;; 3 taps: Switch to another layer
  ;; 4 taps: Escape key
  td (tap-dance 200 (a C-c (layer-switch l2) esc))
)
----

=== one-shot
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+one-shot+` action is similar to "sticky keys", if you know what that is.
This activates an action or key until either the timeout expires or a different
key is pressed. The `+one-shot+` action must be followed by a timeout (unit:
ms) and another key or action.

Some of the intended use cases are:

* pressa modifier for exactly one following key press
* switch to another layer for exactly one following key press

If a `+one-shot+` key is held then it will act as the regular key. E.g. holding
a key assigned with `+@os1+` in the example below will keep Left Shift held for
every key, not just one, as long as it's still physically pressed.

Pressing multiple `+one-shot+` keys in a row within the timeout will combine
the actions of those keys and reset the timeout to the value of the most
recently pressed `+one-shot+` key.

Example:

----
(defalias
  os1 (one-shot 500 lsft)
  os2 (one-shot 2000 (layer-while-held another-layer))
)
----

=== tap-hold
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+tap-hold+` action allows you to have one action/key for a "tap" and a
different action/key for a "hold". A tap is a rapid press then release of the
key whereas a hold is a long press.

The action takes 4 parameters in the listed order:

. tap timeout (unit: ms)
. hold timeout (unit: ms)
. tap action
. hold action

The tap timeout is the number of milliseconds within which a rapid
press+release+press of a key will result in the tap action being held instead
of the hold action activating.

The hold timeout is the number of milliseconds after which the hold action will
activate.

There are two additional variants of `+tap-hold-+`:

* tap-hold-press
** If there is a press of a different key, the hold action is activated even if
the hold timeout hasn't expired yet
* tap-hold-release
** If there is a press+release of a different key, the hold action is activated
even if the hold timeout hasn't expired yet

These variants may be useful if you have want more responsive tap-hold keys,
but you should be wary of activating the hold action unintentionally.

----
(defalias
  anm (tap-hold         200 200 a @num) ;; tap: a      hold: numbers layer
  oar (tap-hold-press   200 200 o @arr) ;; tap: o      hold: arrows layer
  ech (tap-hold-release 200 200 e @chr) ;; tap: e      hold: chords layer
)
----

=== macro
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+macro+` action will tap a sequence of keys or chords with optional
delays. This is different from `+multi+` because in the `+multi+` action,
all keys are held, whereas in `+macro+`, keys are pressed then released.

This means that with `+macro+` you can have some letters capitalized and others
not. This is not possible with `+multi+`.

The `+macro+` action accepts one or more keys, chords, and delays (unit: ms).
The number keys will be parsed as delays, so they must be aliased to be used in
a macro.

Example:

----
(defalias
  : S-;
  8 8
  0 0
  ;; Type "http://localhost:8080"
  lch (macro h t t p @: / / 100 l o c a l h o s t @: @8 @0 @8 @0)
)
----

=== cmd
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+cmd+` action executes a program with arguments. It accepts one or more
strings. The first string is the program that will be run and the following
strings are arguments to that program. The arguments are provided to the
program in the order written in the config file.

NOTE: The command is executed directly and not via a shell, so you cannot make
use of environment variables, e.g. `+~+` or `+$HOME+` in Linux will not be
substituted with your home directory.

Example:

----
(defalias
  cm1 (cmd rm -fr /tmp/testing)

  ;; You can use bash -c and then a quoted string to execute arbitrary text in
  ;; bash. All text within double-quotes is treated as a single string.
  cm2 (cmd bash -c "echo hello world")
)
----

== Advanced/weird features

=== Fake keys
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

You can define up to 256 fake keys. These keys are not directly mapped to any
physical key presses and can only be activated via these actions:

* `+(on-press-fakekey <fake key name> <key action>)+`: Activate a fake key
  action when pressing the key mapped to this action.
* `+(on-release-fakekey <fake key name> <key action>)+`: Activate a fake key
  action when releasing the key mapped to this action.

A fake key can be defined in a `+deffakekeys+` configuration entry. Configuring
this entry is similar to `+defalias+`, but you cannot make use of aliases
inside of `+deffakekeys+` to shorten an action. You can however refer to
previously defined fake keys.

The aforementioned `+<key action>+` can be one of three values:

* `+press+`: Press the fake key. It will not be released until another action
  triggers a release or tap.
* `+release+`: Release the fake key. If it's not already pressed, this does nothing.
* `+tap+`: Press and release the fake key. If it's already pressed, this only releases it.

Example:

----
(deffakekeys
  ctl lctl
  sft lsft
  met lmet
  alt lalt

  ;; Press all modifiers
  pal (multi
        (on-press-fakekey ctl press)
        (on-press-fakekey sft press)
        (on-press-fakekey met press)
        (on-press-fakekey alt press)
      )

  ;; Release all modifiers
  ral (multi
        (on-press-fakekey ctl release)
        (on-press-fakekey sft release)
        (on-press-fakekey met release)
        (on-press-fakekey alt release)
      )
)

(defalias
  psf (on-press-fakekey sft press)
  rsf (on-press-fakekey sft release)

  pal (on-press-fakekey pal tap)
  ral (on-press-fakekey ral tap)
)

(deflayer use-fake-keys
  @psf @rsf @pal @ral a s d f
)
----

If you find that an application isn't registering keypresses correctly with
`+multi+` because the sequence activates too quickly, you can try using fake
key actions alongside the delay actions below.

* `+on-press-fakekey-delay+`
* `+on-release-fakekey-delay+`

Do note that processing a fakekey-delay and even a sequence of delays will
delay any other inputs from being processed until the fakekey-delays are all
complete, so use with care.

----
(defalias
  stm (multi ;; Shift -> middle mouse with a delay
    (on-press-fakekey lsft press)
    (on-press-fakekey-delay 200)
    (on-press-fakekey mmid press)
    (on-release-fakekey mmid release)
    (on-release-fakekey-delay 200)
    (on-release-fakekey lsft release)
  )
)

=== Sequences
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

The `+ldr+` action makes kanata go into "sequence" mode. The action name is
short for "leader". This comes from Vim which has the concept of a configurable
sequence leader key. When in sequence mode, keys are not typed but are saved
until one of the following happens:

* A key is typed that does not match any sequence
* `+sequence-timeout+` milliseconds elapses since the most recent key press

Sequences are configured similarly to `+deffakekeys+`. The first parameter of a
pair must be a defined fake key name. The second parameter is a list of keys
that will activate a fake key tap when typed in the defined order. More
precisely, the action triggered is:

`+(on-press-fakekey <fake key name> tap)+`

Example:

----
(defseq git-status (g s t))
(deffakekeys git-status (macro g i t spc s t a t u s))
(defalias rcl (tap-hold-release 200 200 sldr rctl))

=== Custom tap-hold behaviour
<<table-of-contents,Back to ToC>>

This is not currently configurable without modifying the source code, but if
you're willing and/or capable, there is a tap-hold behaviour that is currently
not exposed. Using this behaviour, one be very particular about when and how
tap vs. hold will activate by using extra information. The available
information that can be used is exactly which keys have been pressed or
released as well as the timing in milliseconds of those key presses.

For more context, you can read the
https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/issues/128[motivation for custom tap-hold behaviour].
